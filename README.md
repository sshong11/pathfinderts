# Pathfinder

Visualizes algorithms such as Dijkstras and A* (A Star) to find the shortest/best path from the starting node to end node in a grid of nodes

### Live site: https://pathfinderts.netlify.app/

## Technologies Used:
* HTML / CSS (Sass)
* TypeScript
* React
* Ruby on Rails (for CRUD component)

## To Do
* Clear Paths button (not walls)
* Clear grid when running algorithm again
* Weighted nodes
* Mouse events replace start/end node)
* State for when animation/algorithm is running (can place walls or move during)
* Drag start/end nodes instead of changing value
* More algorithms

## Challenges
* Understanding then implementing algorithms (even with video tutorials)
* JS to TS (for CRUD)
* Many edge cases to fix
* Time(?)
